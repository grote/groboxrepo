Summary: Fork of the official Home Assistant app
Description: |-
    This fork of the official Home Assistant companion app
    removes all non-free code and dependencies from the app
    making it Free Software.

    and at present, the missing functionality is not replaced
    with free alternatives.

    Removed non-free functionality:
    * Push messages with Firebase (FCM/GCM)
    * Location Tracking with Play Services (could be replaced)
    * Translations with Lokalise SDK
