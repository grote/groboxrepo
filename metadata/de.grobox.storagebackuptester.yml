Name: Storage Backup Tester
Summary: Help test storage backups
Description: |-
    An app to test upcoming Seedvault storage backups.
    You can use it to simulate a backup.
    Your files won't be changed and not uploaded anywhere.
    This is just to test code for a future real backup.
    By testing you can make sure that *your* backups will work.
      
    Please come back to this app from time to time
    and run a backup again to see if it correctly identifies
    files that were added/changed.
      
    Thanks for testing!
